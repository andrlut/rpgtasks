# RPG Tasks

Gamified habit tracker for Android. **V0 shipped and being tested live on device.** Sandbox project intended to grow with the user's brother as a second contributor later (not active yet).

---

## Read first — working style

The user is **visual and empirical**: they want to see things working to know what they want next. Strong preference for **action over planning** on this sandbox.

- Big PRs are OK (whole-feature shipping > many tiny PRs)
- Admin-merging own PRs on `main` is OK here (single-dev sandbox; protection exists for the future when their brother joins)
- Don't ask before routine decisions — pick something reasonable and ship
- "manda bala", "tá bala", "pode fazer tudo" = green light, full speed

This applies to **velocity and ceremony only** — security, RLS, secret hygiene stay strict.

## Database schema (10 migrations applied to cloud)

Tables in `public`:

| Table | Notes |
|---|---|
| `profile` | 1:1 with `auth.users`. display_name, avatar_url |
| `character` | 1:1 with profile. total_xp, coins |
| `dimension` | catalog: health, strength, mind, wealth, social, discipline (color, icon) |
| `character_dimension` | per-user XP per dimension (composite PK) |
| `task` | character-owned. title, difficulty 1-5, **recurrence jsonb** (one_shot/daily/weekly+days/monthly+day), **target_count int** (1-50), legacy `task_type` enum kept for compat, is_archived |
| `task_dimension` | M:N task ↔ dimension (a task can grant XP in multiple dims) |
| `task_completion` | **immutable** — guards xp_granted, coins_granted at the moment of completion |
| `reward` | character-owned. title, cost, icon, **category** (indulgence/good/experience), is_archived |
| `reward_redemption` | **immutable** — cost_paid history |
| `reward_template` | catalog: public-read suggestions users can clone into their own shop (title, cost, icon, category, sort_order) |
| `skill` | catalog: pushups, running, meditate, reading (display_name, unit, dimension_id, icon) |
| `skill_tier` | catalog ladder: 5 tiers per skill (beginner / bronze / silver / gold / master + threshold) |
| `skill_log` | per-user PR entries, immutable |
| `quest` | character-owned. title, deadline, status (active/completed/failed/expired/abandoned), reward_xp/coins, allow_partial, optional template_id |
| `quest_requirement` | per-quest goal rows (kind: complete_task_n_times / complete_any_in_dim / reach_skill_value); progress is computed on read by joining `task_completion` / `skill_log` against the quest's window |
| `quest_template` | catalog: public-read suggestions users can clone into their own quest list (title, description, category, suggested_duration_days, reward_xp/coins, requirements jsonb) |

RLS on every table; "self-only" except catalog tables (dimension/skill/skill_tier are public-read for authenticated users).

RPCs:
- `complete_task(p_task_id uuid, p_completed_at timestamptz default null) → json` — atomic: validates ownership, computes XP/coins from difficulty, writes `task_completion`, bumps `character.total_xp` + `coins`, bumps `character_dimension.xp` for linked dims. Optional `p_completed_at` (≤ now) supports retroactive logging from the History tab; defaults to `now()` for live taps.
- `redeem_reward(p_reward_id uuid) → json` — atomic balance debit with insufficient-funds error.
- `start_quest_from_template(p_template_id) → uuid` / `start_custom_quest(p_payload jsonb) → uuid` — clone a template (resolving `task_title` to the user's task by case-insensitive title match) or create a fully custom quest with explicit requirements. Both return the new quest id.
- `complete_quest(p_quest_id) → json` — credits the quest's `reward_xp` + `reward_coins` and flips status to `completed`. Defense-in-depth ownership/active-status check; client computes "all requirements met?" before calling.
- `expire_overdue_quests() → integer` — bulk-marks the user's overdue active quests as `expired`. Called from the client on each quest list fetch (idempotent and cheap).
- `delete_task_completion(p_completion_id uuid) → json` — undo for a mis-tapped retro completion. Subtracts the row's xp/coins from the character + linked dimensions (clamped at 0), then deletes the row. Reachable via long-press on a completion in the History day detail.

Trigger `handle_new_user()` on `auth.users` insert:
- creates profile + character + 6 character_dimension rows
- seeds 6 sample tasks (`seed_sample_tasks`)
- **does NOT auto-seed rewards** — users browse the `reward_template` catalog and tap to add (since migration 006). The legacy `seed_sample_rewards` function still exists but is no longer called from the trigger.

`seed_sample_tasks` is idempotent and was backfilled for existing users when introduced.

## Workflow conventions

- **Branches**: `feat/<short>`, `fix/<short>`, `chore/<short>`, `docs/<short>`
- **Commits**: Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`)
- **Co-author trailer**: every commit ends with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>`
- **PRs**: open with `gh pr create`, merge with `gh pr merge <n> --squash --admin --delete-branch`
- **After merge**: `git switch main && git pull --rebase`
- **CI**: typecheck (app + shared) + lint (app); both must be green before merge
- **Branch protection**: `main` requires 1 approval — admin bypass is acceptable on this sandbox while solo

---

## Pre-commit checks (always run before opening a PR)

```bash
cd app && npx tsc --noEmit && npx expo lint
```

Both must pass clean. Lint catches `react/no-unescaped-entities` (apostrophes/quotes inside `<Text>`) — escape with HTML entities or rephrase.

---

## Local development

```bash
pnpm install                    # at root, once
cd app
pnpm dev                        # starts Expo dev server on port 8081
# scan QR with Expo Go on phone (same Wi-Fi)
# or pnpm dev --tunnel  for remote
```

If new routes don't show up (Unmatched Route screen), restart the dev server with `pnpm dev --clear` to flush Metro cache.

---

## Credentials & env state (NOT in repo)

User-level env vars (persist across all terminals on this machine):
- `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` — PAT, used by `supabase` CLI and Management API
- `EXPO_TOKEN` — used by `eas` CLI for builds and login

App env (`app/.env.local`, gitignored):
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://uneqnpyzevosznwkmvvo.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=sb_publishable_sWLt4U0F5J4S-Se-6V7SXw_1LyQqysV
```

The publishable key is safe in client (RLS protects). The service_role key has been flagged by Supabase as exposed — DO NOT reuse it from chat history. If admin DB access is needed, use `supabase` CLI (token-authed) or ask the user to rotate and provide a fresh value.

## Common change recipes

| Want to | Do this |
|---|---|
| Add a new feature with schema | New file `supabase/migrations/<timestamp>_<name>.sql` → `supabase db push --linked` |
| Add a new screen | File under `app/app/`, register in `app/app/_layout.tsx` `<Stack>` |
| Add a new API hook | File under `app/lib/api/<domain>.ts`; mirror existing hook patterns |
| Add a new UI component | File under `app/components/`; use design tokens from `app/theme` |
| Tweak colors / spacing / radii | `app/theme/tokens.ts` (single source of truth — also reflected in `design/tokens.css`) |
| Build an APK | `cd app && eas build --platform android --profile preview --non-interactive --no-wait` |
| Apply migration to cloud | `cd "C:\Users\André Luthold\RPG"` then `supabase db push --linked` |

## Known caveats

- **Supabase CLI on Windows**: standalone binary at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\supabase\supabase.exe`. PATH set as user env var; new terminals see it. Smart App Control sometimes flags it — use absolute path if "term not recognized".
- **Service_role key flagging**: Supabase blocks calls from "browser-like" User-Agents. Use `User-Agent: supabase-cli/2.95.4` if you ever need to fall back to direct admin REST.
- **Auth redirect URL** is the deep link `rpgtasks://auth/callback` (computed via `expo-linking`'s `createURL`). The app handles incoming auth URLs in `lib/auth/deep-link.ts` and exchanges them for a session. **Manual dashboard config required** in Supabase → Auth → URL Configuration: set **Site URL** = `rpgtasks://auth/callback` and add it under **Redirect URLs**. Without this step, email-confirmation links still go to `localhost:3000`. Magic links / OTP / PKCE / fragment-based flows are all handled.
- **Custom schemes need a dev/production build** — Expo Go strips them, so test the email-confirm flow in `eas build --profile development` (or `preview`/`production`), not in Expo Go.
- **expo-updates is installed and working** — OTA hot-fixes via `eas update --channel preview` push JS/TS changes to the existing APK without a rebuild. The Settings tab has a "check for updates" button users can tap to pull manually. Native code changes (new packages, native modules, version bumps) still require a fresh `eas build`. **Prefer `eas update` over `eas build`** whenever the change is JS/TS-only — saves ~15 min per change.
